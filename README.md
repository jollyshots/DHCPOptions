# DHCPOptions
This script will create the DHCP options for SfB per scope.
This is desgined to work with On-Premise SfB Only.
It is desgined so you can in one step add DHCP Options for Provisioning and SfB without having to copy files, etc... between servers.
You need to have write access to DHCP scopes as well as read "Topology configuration" from SfB (Or Lync).
