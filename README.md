# DHCPOptions
This script will create the DHCP options for SfB per scope.<br>
It will setup all the DHCP classes and options needed for SfB, including Polycom Provisioning.<br>
You should have write access to DHCP and be able to read topolgy from SfB to make this work seamlessly<br>
If you don't have write access to DHCP, it will spit out powershell for a DHCP Server<br>
You no longer are stuck with setting global options, you can now set information per scope<br>
